## **WHO IS OFA?**

Organizing for Action is a movement of millions of Americans, coming together to fight for real, lasting change. We are proud community organizers who are building this organization from the ground up, community by community, one conversation at a time—whether that’s on a front porch or on Facebook. We’re committed to finding and training the next generation of great progressive organizers, because at the end of the day, we aren’t the first to fight for progressive change, and we won’t be the last. This is bigger than just one person or one cause.

The 5 million Americans who’ve taken action with OFA are part of a long line of people who stand up and take on the big fights for social justice, basic fairness, equal rights, and expanding opportunity. That kind of progress is never easy. But we’re not here for the easy fights and we’re glad to have you join us.

OFA is as committed as we've ever been to defending the progress we’ve made over the past eight years and growing this movement for the long-term. As always, we'll need your voice and your energy to effect real change. Now is the time for us to do what we do best—organize.
